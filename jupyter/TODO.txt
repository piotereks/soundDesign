ImproTool (python) next steps

1. Dependency between pattern and rythm (default, configurable, on-the fly)
2. Implementation of rythm pattern (isobar, some manual patterns with CC codes?)

Define base pattern (as dataset) and play it
Adopt combination o patterns, scales and note leghts (pattern vs decorators)

3. Detect read song bpm and adopt played patterns
4. Pattern can be selected, can be random
5. Add keyboard or midi steering for scales, pattern, leghts
6. Add pattern selection depending on interval provided from keyboard
7. Later scales can be suggested, selected, randomised,
8. Predefined sets for differen kind of music e.g. blues kater jazz, any others types
9. Add your scales to scale.py
Evetuallly Gather different backgrounds tracks for standard genres
Myltiinstrument support
Tensor flow/magenta generations? Or maybe tensor selected impro patterns


Problems:
1) How to deal with lengths of notes and tempo, specially when converting to midi events.
This calculation seem to be heart of playing.
Can isobar be used for that?

2) Midi clock support.

3) when using isobar and timeline - how to add additional sounds  - timeline.background() instead of run()
